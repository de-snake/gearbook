# Executing transactions

## Using Gearbox open-sourced Safe Permissionless UI

{% hint style="success" %}
[Permissionless Safe](https://docs.gearbox.fi/gearbox-permissionless-doc/competitive-advantages/essential-tooling-for-curators#permissionless-safe) is an open-source, IPFS-hosted version of the Safe Multisig UI designed to review and sign transactions securely in a human-readable format. It eliminates backend dependencies to mitigate risks like Bybit-type attacks and performs checks of IPFS CID signature to prevent phishing.
