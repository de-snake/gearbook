# A day of a curator

Morpho has pioneered the concept of curated lending markets in DeFi, but its approach differs significantly from Gearbox's model. Below is a clear comparison of how curators function in each protocol:

### Morpho: Active Capital Allocation

In Morpho, curators are active capital allocators. They:

* Distribute depositors' funds across various yield-generating markets.
* Operate within markets defined by immutable parameters, such as Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and oracles.

### Gearbox: Risk Parameter Management

In Gearbox, curators have a more limited role, focusing solely on risk management. They:

* Set risk parameters for markets, such as LTV ratios or liquidation thresholds.
* Have no authority to move or allocate depositors' funds, which remain under user or protocol control.
